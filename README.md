([Slides and Videos](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1rC8UCT9DMCtQHnQ-OpHPE8U3iM7HJ5_Ouow8o4d7h84/) for part 1: Robot Control with Keyboard)

The code for controlling the robot was written with Python 3.9.2.

[Robot](http://www.xiaorgeek.com/vehicle-robots/tank-robots/raspberry-pi-tank.html) from XiaoRGeek was used in this project.

[Putty](https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/latest.html) and [WinSCP](https://winscp.net/eng/index.php) was used to communicate with the raspberry pi in the robot.

## Executing Code
RobotMain is the main code of this program

With putty opened, ```python RobotMain.py``` can be executed at its path.
